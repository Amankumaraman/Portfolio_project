# Portfolio_project

Created a professional portfolio website using HTML and CSS.
                The website showcases my skills, experience, and projects in a
                visually appealing and organized manner. The site is fully
                responsive and features a clean and modern design, making it
                easy for potential employers or clients to learn more about my
                work and capabilities.
